Link to a customized webpage
============================

You can create a customized webpage and use the nb-dispatch javascript library and Nucleome Bridge web browser extension to link `Nucleome Browser <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nucleome-bridge/djcdicpaejhpgncicoglfckiappkoeof>`_ with your webpages.
Examples of customized web pages we created are shown `here <https://vis.nucleome.org/static/demos>`_

Link to DCIC Jupyter notebook
=============================

The following example shows that it is possible to link the Nucleome Browser with the Jupyter notebook server provided by the 4DN DCIC. Users can process the raw 4DN data in the Jupyter notebook. Once users highlight some regions on the Nucleome Browser, the violin plot on the right will only show the genomic regions overlapping with the highlighted region on the Nucleome Browser.
