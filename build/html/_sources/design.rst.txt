Panel-container system

Overview
========

Nucleome Browser adopts the concept of modular design in its architecture. 
First, we created a series of composable, configurable, and communicable web components (i.e., customized HTML elements) to visualize and explore different types of data. 
Each web component is built to handle a specific type of data (e.g., genomic data, 3D genome structures, or imaging data).
Next, we standardized different web components into web-containers (web panels) with the same interface such that these different web components can **communicate** with each other. 
Therefore, users can combine multiple components/panels into tabs of the web browser in a flexible and user-friendly manner. 
Currently, two types of the messages triggered by a user can transmit bidirectionaly across web components,  including 1) current viewed genomic regions; 2) highlighted genomic regions. 
Furthermore, Nucleome Browser supports messages dispatching between web panels in the same web tab, across web tabs in the same domain, or even across web tabs in different domains (e.g., the UCSC Genome Browser). 
This versatile and powerful feature is achieved through a hierarchical ``event-driven communication`` protocol. 
To summarize, the Nucleome Browser is the first web-based platform that supports interactively browsing multi-modal.

    The roadmap of the Nucleome Browser: from data service to synchronization of heterogeneous web components

What is a panel?
================

Web panel is perhaps the most important concept introduced by Nucleome Browser.
You can consider different web panels as Lego bricks such that they have distinct functionalities while still possess the ability to **communicate** with each other.
In Nucleome Browser, web panels are all contained in the same panel-container system, allowing web panels to synchronize with each other.
Next, we will formally introduce some basic operations of web panels, including the creation of a new web panel, duplication of existing web panel, a panel-space widget to conveniently organize web panels, .etc.

Create a new panel
==================

Creating a new panel is easy.
When the mouse hovers on the ``plus`` button (|top-plus|) on the top menu bar, a drop-down menu will appear showing all the different types of web component/panel.
Clicking one type of web panel, a default panel will be added to the current web tab.

    Users can create a new panel using the top menu bar

Basic operations
================

A panel is like a sub-tab in the current web tab.
You can control each panel using the configuration toolbar located on the top-right of its frame.
:numref:`panel_menu` shows the function of each button on the panel's configuration toolbar.

    :align: center
    :figwidth: 640px

    Panel configuration toolbar on the top-right corner

**Configuration mode of a panel**

Clicking the ``configuration`` button (|panel-config|), you will see the configuration interface of this panel if that panel has the configuration mode. 
In the configuration mode (the configuration button will turn to green color), you can go back to the visualization mode by clicking the button again.

**Rename a panel**

Clicking the ``rename`` button (|panel-rename|), you will see a dialog popping out.
You can then change the title of the this panel.
This title will also be the default name when you save this panel to the panel space.

**Save a panel to panel space**

Clicking the ``save`` button (|panel-save|), you can save the current panel into the panel space, which is hosted locally in the web browserâ€™s IndexedDB.
To view saved panels in the panel space, you can click the panel space button (|panel-space|) on the top menu bar.
A window of panel space will be shown on the left side of the panel.
Users can load panels saved in the panel space to the current web tab using the upload button (|panel-upload|) or delete saved panels using buttons next to each panel using the delete button (|panel-delete|).
Panel space works similarly as the bookmarks of the web browser, allowing users to easily re-use and compose previous panels from different sessions.
Notably, since panels in the panel space are saved into the web browser's IndexedDB, you will not find them if you use another computer.

**Duplicate a panel**

Clicking the ``duplication`` button (|panel-duplicate|) of a panel, you can duplicate this panel in the same web tab.
This feature is useful when you want to create a similar panel by making small changes to an existing panel.
It is also quite useful if you can create a similar genome browser panel with different zooming factors.

**Pop-out and pop-in a panel**

Nucleome Browser allows users to create panels in different web tabs.
Notably, panels in different web tabs are all synchronized with each other.
However, there is a main tab to which all the other extended panels are attached.
If you close the main tab, all the extended panels will also be closed.
There are two ways to create an extended panel.
First, you can click the ``pop-out`` button (|panel-pop-out|) to convert a panel into an individual web window.
Once a panel becomes a pop-out window, the ``pop-out`` button (|panel-pop-out|) will turn into a ``pop-in`` button (|panel-pop-in|).
Clicking the pop-in button, the pop-out panel will be added back to the main tab.
In the second method, you can create an extended panel by clicking the ``Extended Window`` button (|panel-extra|) in the drop-down menu of the ``plus`` button on the top menu bar.

**Maximize a panel / Back to standard view**

Clicking the ``maximization`` button (|panel-max|) of a panel, you will see the panel taking the full width of the current web browser. 
You can click the ``minimization`` button (|panel-min|) of that panel to change back to the compact layout.

**Close a panel**

You can close a panel by clicking the ``close`` button (|panel-close|).

Flexible layout
===============

Nucleome Browser uses `Golden Layout <https://golden-layout.com>`_ to control the layout of panels in the same web tab.
Users can move a panel to the desired position by clicking the title of a panel, holding the mouse, and dragging it to different positions of the web tab.
The system will automatically adjust the height or the width of the panel (usually by horizontally splitting or vertically splitting panels) and show the preview of that panel as a grey box.
You can arrange panels side-by-side or stack one on top of other panels.
To resize a panel, you can move the mouse to the boundary of a panel.
The mouse will turn into a resizing form when it close to the boundary of a panel. 
You can then click and hold the mouse to change the height or width of a panel.
